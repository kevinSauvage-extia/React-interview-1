## Goal

Create a React application that retrieves and displays users



## UX/UI

Up to you, probably it should include an input to enter the username, one area to display the repositories of the user and another area to display the organisations.



### Retrieving data

todo -> API



### Bootstrapping the project

Up to you, we recommend create-react-app.



### Submitting the solution

Copy this repository to a repository on your name and add the solution there. It should be clear how to build and run the project locally.




### Bonus
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await
* Adding a spinner when information is loading
* Deal with errors coming from the backend
* Some sort of Unit Test
* Divide the application in different pages and use a router
* Adding state management
* Deploy the project somewhere
