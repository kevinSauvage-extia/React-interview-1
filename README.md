## Goal

The goal of this small project is to create a small webapp displaying users and their related posts (data are located on [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)).



## Bootstrapping the project

Up to you, we recommend create-react-app.


## UX/UI

Up to you


## Retrieving data
Add the option to fetch each user's posts on jsonplaceholder and display them with their user.
The name of each user should be editable and should send the update to the server (note that the update is faked on jsonplaceholder).


## Submitting the solution

Store the project to a Github repository at your name (need to be a public repo). It should be clear how to build and run the project locally.




## Bonus
* Use ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring, and async/await
* Adding a spinner when information is loading
* Deal with errors coming from the backend
* Some sort of Unit Test
* Divide the application into different pages and use a router
* Adding state management
* Deploy the project somewhere
